# computational-physics-from-ustc

It is a compulsory course in ustc. The homeworks will cost much time to finish so feel free to refer to mine, which is written in python. But don't just copy everything without thinking.

I believe my homeworks are mainly correct according to my final score(A+). 

If you have problem in programming language, it's really helpful to ask AI and find some short videos online, since you only need to learn the most fundimental things.
